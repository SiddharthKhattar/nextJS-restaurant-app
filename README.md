This repository contains the code for a front end website with a focus on UI/UX design and aesthetics. The website presents users with a mockup to an Italian Pizza Website and contains multiple webpages such as a cart page, orders page, login page along with others. It also has extensive CSS applied to it to create a visually pleasing aesthetic in fun and interesting ways. You can view the website by downloading the files on your PC and running it on your localhost. It is made with a mobile-first approach on design with proper scaling across a tablet screen and desktop.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
